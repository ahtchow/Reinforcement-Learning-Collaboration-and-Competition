    "In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.\n",

    "\n",
    "The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,\n",
    "\n",
    "- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.\n",

    "- This yields a single score for each episode.\n",
    "The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Traditional reinforcement learning approaches such as Q-Learning or policy gradient\n",
    "are poorly suited to multi-agent environments. One issue is that each agent’s policy is changing\n",
    "as training progresses, and the environment becomes non-stationary from the perspective of any\n",
    "individual agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General Purpose Multi-Agent Learning Algorithm**:\n",
    " - (1) leads to learned policies that only use local information (i.e. their own observations) at execution time \n",
    " - (2) does not assume a differentiable model of the environment dynamics or any particular structure on the communication method between agents\n",
    " - (3) is applicable not only to cooperative interaction but to competitive or mixed interaction involving both physical and communicative behavior.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Solution**: actor-critic policy gradient methods where the critic is\n",
    "augmented with extra information about the policies of other agents, while the actor only has access to local information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents can either be cooperative, competitive, or both and many\n",
    "algorithms are designed only for a particular nature of interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent i aims to maximize its own total expected return.\n",
    "- Markov Games, Q-Learning, DQN, Policy Gradient Algorithms all struggle for their own reasons\n",
